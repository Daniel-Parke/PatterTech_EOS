# Templates · Canonical artefact formats

Copy exactly; front-matter keys are contracts other sessions and future
automation rely on. Dates ISO (`YYYY-MM-DD`). IDs are allocated by
taking the next number in the relevant directory or file; check before
writing.

## Queue item (a row of `org/QUEUE.md`)

```markdown
### WO-#### · <title>
- type: FEAT|FIX|REFACTOR|PERF|MAINT|HARDEN|COMPLY|RESEARCH|DOCS|OPS|SPIKE
  · tier: T1|T2|T3 · priority: P0|P1|P2|P3 · status: ready|in_progress|
  in_verification|blocked
- acceptance: [ ] checkable criteria, one box each
- done when: <the observable finish line, including the gates>
```

Queue sections: Ready (ordered), Blocked, Done (id, session, date).
Done rows may be pruned a quarter after completion; git keeps history.

## Decision · `org/decisions/ADR-####-<slug>.md`

```markdown
